// End a hook process without tripping libuv on Windows.
//
// The failure this exists to prevent, seen in a real Stop hook:
//
//   Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING), file src\win\async.c, line 76
//   exit code 3221226505 (0xC0000409)
//
// Cursor reports that as a failed hook even though the checkpoint itself had completed — the work
// was done and the analytics were reported; the process died on the way out.
//
// The cause is `process.exit()` racing libuv: forcing teardown while an async handle is still
// mid-close fast-fails the process. Draining undici's keep-alive pool first and yielding a loop
// tick narrows that window but does not close it — the assertion was observed with exactly that
// mitigation in place, on Node v24 with a healthy API.
//
// So the normal path no longer forces anything. Set `process.exitCode` and let the loop drain:
// once the pool is closed nothing is left holding it open, and a process that exits on its own has
// no handle to race. The forced exit survives only as a backstop for a stray handle (a lingering
// socket, a timer some dependency left behind), where by definition nothing is mid-close any more.
